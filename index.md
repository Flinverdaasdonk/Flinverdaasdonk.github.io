Hi! My name is Flin, and I'm currently a PhD Researcher at [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/) and [Alliander](https://www.alliander.com/nl/) (the largest Dutch DSO), in the [AI for Energy Grids lab](https://icai.ai/icai-labs/ai-for-energy-grids/). My research is on how we're going to control the distribution grid of the future. I'm currently exploring the combination is optimization, mathematical modelling, and machine learning techniques to enable this control.

On this blog I'll mostly post things related to my research.

## My research direction
Due to rapid electrification (such as electric vehicles and electric heating) and increased decentralized energy production (such as solar panels and wind energy) the distribution grid is becoming increasingly volatile and congested. At the same time assets with some degree of control are being deployed on the distribution grid. To ensure stable grid operation and facilitate the energy transition, I'll research how we can control these assets in a way that is scalabale, safe, performant, and fair. 

Although centralized control of these assets would be 'more optimal', in practice this is unfeasible for several reasons. (1) it'll be impossible to control thousands or millions of assets in real time from a computational point of view. (2) The existing infrastructure does not allow for this, since there isn't enough communication bandwidth for all these assets. (3) There are valid privacy, and cybersecurity concerns when doing the optimization centrally. This means we want to control the distribution grid in a way that is decentralized, based on local information.
